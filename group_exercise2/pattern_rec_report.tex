\section{DTW}

The results from our DTW are included below. Unfortunately the results are not as favorable as we would like. I believe that this could be due to incorrectly normalized feature vectors, however I'm not sure of the effect that this would have on the overall outcome.

\section{Challenge}

For the challenge, we created the file "tv\_challenge2.py". It takes the results from the DTW files and make the dissimilarities for the 10 keywords (that it takes from the locations) and store them in the "challenge.tsv" file.
